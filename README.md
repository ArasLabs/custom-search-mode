# Custom Search Mode

This package contains two samples of creating a Custom Search Mode to be used in addition to the default Simple, Advanced, and AML search modes.

The first is a simple example that uses two fields to allow users to search on Parts by their Item Numbers and Names. This search mode is explicitly limited to the Part ItemType.

The second demonstrates an example that allows users to search on items based on the Parent Package they are in. This search mode is intended to be used to search upon administrative items like ItemTypes, Methods, Forms, etc, but it is not explicitly limited to any specific ItemTypes.
